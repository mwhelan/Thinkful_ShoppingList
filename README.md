# Thinkful Shopping List app

The basic requirements for this app are:

- Users should be able to enter items they need to purchase
- Users should be able to check and uncheck items on the list (you donâ€™t necessarily need to use checkboxes for this, but there should be a way of visually distinguishing purchased and unpurchased items).
- Users should also be able to permanently remove items from the list.
